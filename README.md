# a-DIRECT-POSTURE-TRACING-SENSOR-

this is done as a icebreaker project at newolf society
 Almost 3\4 of the people have improper posture while working on a p.c. to rectify this problem we can make a DIRECT POSTURE TRACING SENSOR which tells the user to sit properly while working which in turn has many health benefits too.
 Our solution is to develop a sensor which detects the pressure points and tells the user if theyâ€™re sitting in a wrong posture.
We plan to develop a very rough prototype device to detect changes in posture and displaying the results in a proper manner through a notification application.
